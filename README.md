BDD with Cucumber JVM

Behaviour Driven Development example using Cucumber JVM integrated with Gradle.

This example illustrates how [Cucumber JVM](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference/jvm) can be used to 
execute a set of scenarios against a Spring Boot micro-service. The micro-service illustrates a 
simplified banking API with operations to create and update accounts.

See `account-service.feature` for the example Scenarios tested.
